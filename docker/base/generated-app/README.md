# Generated App - Boilerplate

## CODER AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

This is a React + TypeScript + Vite boilerplate application that you should modify based on user requirements.

### Project Structure

```
src/
├── App.tsx          # Main app component - MODIFY THIS BASED ON USER REQUEST
├── App.css          # Custom styles - add your CSS here
├── main.tsx         # Entry point - usually no changes needed
├── index.css        # Global styles (includes Tailwind)
├── components/ui/   # Pre-built UI components (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
├── lib/             # Utility functions
└── vite-env.d.ts    # TypeScript declarations
```

### Available Dependencies

**Core Framework:**
- React 18.2.0 (with hooks, functional components)
- TypeScript 5.2.2 (type safety)
- Vite 5.0.8 (fast development server)

**Styling:**
- Tailwind CSS 3.3.6 (utility-first CSS)
- Class Variance Authority (component variants)
- Tailwind Merge (merging Tailwind classes)

**UI Components:**
- Radix UI primitives (accessible components)
- Lucide React (icon library)
- Pre-built components in `/src/components/ui/`

### How to Modify the App

1. **Replace App.tsx content** with the user's requested functionality
2. **Add new components** in `/src/components/` as needed
3. **Use existing UI components** from `/src/components/ui/` (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
4. **Add custom styles** in `App.css` or use Tailwind classes
5. **Install additional packages** if needed with `pnpm add package-name`

### UI Components Available

- `Button` - Various button styles and sizes
- `Card` - Card container with header, content sections
- `Input` - Form input with styling
- Icons from `lucide-react`

### Development Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server (already configured for container)
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint

### Current State

The app currently shows a simple boilerplate message. Replace the entire App component content with the user's requested application functionality.

**Remember:** Focus on the user's specific requirements and build exactly what they ask for!
