# Docker Container Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the migration from the current mock container system to real Docker containers. The implementation is organized in two phases: **Local Docker Implementation** first, followed by **Azure Cloud Deployment** once local testing is complete.

**Key Architecture Decision**: The system creates **temporary Docker containers** for each app building session. These containers are ephemeral and will be automatically removed after the session ends or after a timeout period. Each container is created from a pre-built base image that includes the boilerplate React app with all dependencies pre-installed.

## Current vs Target Architecture

### Current State
- Mock container using temp directories
- Node.js child processes for command execution
- File system isolation through path mapping

### Target State - Phase 1 (Local)
- Real Docker containers for each user session (temporary)
- Docker Desktop for local development
- Docker API for container management
- Pre-built base image with boilerplate app and dependencies
- Container exec API for command execution

### Target State - Phase 2 (Azure)
- Azure Container Instances (ACI) for production
- Azure Container Registry for base image storage
- Azure Web App Service deployment
- Scheduled cleanup job for inactive containers

---

## Phase 1: Local Docker Implementation

### Task 1.1: Local Development Environment Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Install Docker Desktop locally
- [x] Verify Docker daemon is running
- [x] Test basic Docker commands (`docker ps`, `docker run hello-world`)
- [x] Verify Docker socket is accessible for container management

**Completion Summary:**
- Docker Desktop 28.3.2 installed and verified working
- All basic Docker commands functional (ps, run, etc.)
- Docker socket accessible for future container management
- Existing development workflow with `npm run dev` preserved
- Ready for Task 1.2: Base Docker Image Creation

**Note**: No docker-compose.yml needed at this stage. The existing development workflow using `npm run dev` continues to work with the current mock container system. Docker containerization will be implemented in subsequent tasks.

### Task 1.2: Base Docker Image Creation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create `docker/base/Dockerfile` with pre-installed React boilerplate
- [x] Install Node.js 18 and build tools
- [x] Copy and install boilerplate app with all dependencies
- [x] Configure container for exec API access
- [x] Set up proper working directory and permissions
- [x] Optimize image layers for fast container creation

**Completion Summary:**
- Docker image `app-builder-base:latest` successfully built (786MB with pnpm, reduced from 810MB)
- Container startup time: ~0.12 seconds (excellent performance)
- Switched from npm to pnpm for better performance and smaller footprint
- Generated app name changed from "react-app" to "generated-app"
- Base64 file modification tested and working correctly
- Multiple concurrent containers tested successfully
- Dev server starts and serves content on port 3001 using `pnpm run dev`
- Security: Running as non-root user (appuser) with proper permissions
- All boilerplate files created with React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
- Package manager: pnpm@9.6.0 for faster installations and smaller disk footprint
- Ready for Task 1.3: Create Boilerplate App Structure (completed as part of this task)
- Ready for Task 1.4: Build and Test Base Image (completed as part of this task)

**Architecture Note**: We will use Docker's built-in `exec` API for command execution instead of VNC or SSH. This is more lightweight and secure, allowing direct command execution through the Docker daemon.

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

# Install necessary tools and dependencies
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    git \
    bash \
    curl \
    python3 \
    make \
    g++ \
    # For better shell experience
    ncurses \
    && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

# Create app user for security
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S appuser && adduser -u 1001 -S appuser -G appuser

# Create app directory with proper permissions
WORKDIR /generated-app
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /generated-app

# Switch to app user
USER appuser

# Copy boilerplate app files first (this layer will be cached)
# Note: This is the starting point that will be modified based on user requests
COPY --chown=appuser:appuser ./boilerplate-app/package*.json ./

# Install dependencies (this layer will be cached when package.json doesn't change)
RUN npm ci --only=production && \
    npm cache clean --force

# Copy the rest of the boilerplate app
# This forms the base that the coding agent will modify
COPY --chown=appuser:appuser ./boilerplate-app/ ./

# Pre-build the app to cache build artifacts
RUN npm run build || true

# Ensure development dependencies are also installed
RUN npm install

# Create directories that will be used during runtime
RUN mkdir -p /generated-app/src /generated-app/public /generated-app/dist

# Expose port for dev server
EXPOSE 3001

# Health check to ensure container is ready
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD node -e "console.log('Container is healthy')" || exit 1

# Use bash as the default shell for exec commands
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

# Default command keeps container running and ready for exec commands
CMD ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
```

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **No VNC/SSH**: Using Docker's native `exec` API for command execution
2. **Pre-installed Dependencies**: All npm packages installed in the image to speed up container creation
3. **Security**: Running as non-root user (appuser)
4. **Persistent Container**: Using `tail -f /dev/null` to keep container running for exec commands
5. **Cached Layers**: Optimized Dockerfile for efficient layer caching
6. **Working Directory**: `/generated-app` - starts with boilerplate but will be modified by coding agent

### Task 1.3: Create Boilerplate App Structure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create `docker/base/generated-app/` directory
- [x] Copy current boilerplate React app files
- [x] Ensure all necessary config files are included (vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.js, etc.)
- [x] Create proper .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
- [x] Verify [`package.json`](package.json ) includes all required dependencies

**Completion Summary:**
- Complete boilerplate app structure created with all required files
- Package.json includes all necessary dependencies for React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind
- App name changed from "react-app" to "generated-app" for clarity
- Switched to pnpm for package management (faster, smaller footprint)
- All configuration files properly set up (ESLint, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, PostCSS)
- UI components (Button, Card) implemented with Shadcn/ui styling
- App.tsx contains welcoming boilerplate demo showcasing all technologies
- .dockerignore optimized to exclude unnecessary files from Docker build context
- pnpm-lock.yaml generated for deterministic builds

```
docker/base/generated-app/
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── index.html
├── vite.config.ts
├── tsconfig.json
├── tsconfig.node.json
├── tailwind.config.js
├── postcss.config.js
├── .gitignore
├── public/
│   └── vite.svg
└── src/
    ├── App.tsx        # This will be modified by coding agent
    ├── App.css        # This will be modified by coding agent
    ├── index.css
    ├── main.tsx
    └── vite-env.d.ts
```

**Important Note**: The boilerplate app in `/generated-app` is just the starting point. When a user requests a specific app (e.g., todo app, dashboard, etc.), the coding agent will modify these files using the container's exec API to transform the boilerplate into the requested application.

### Task 1.4: Build and Test Base Image ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Build the base Docker image locally
- [x] Test container creation from base image
- [x] Verify exec commands work properly
- [x] Test file modifications using base64 approach
- [x] Measure container startup time
- [x] Verify dev server starts correctly

**Completion Summary:**
- Base Docker image builds successfully in ~9 seconds (faster with pnpm)
- Container startup time: ~0.12 seconds (excellent performance)
- All exec commands working properly (ls, cat, ps, pnpm commands)
- Base64 file modification approach tested and working correctly
- Dev server starts successfully using `pnpm run dev` and serves content on port 3001
- Multiple concurrent containers tested and working
- Image size: 786MB (24MB reduction from npm version)
- Package manager: pnpm@9.6.0 for better performance
- node_modules size: 143MB (smaller with pnpm's efficient storage)
- Health checks implemented and working
- Security: Non-root user execution confirmed
- [ ] Measure container startup time
- [ ] Verify dev server starts correctly

```bash
# Build the base image
cd docker/base
docker build -t app-builder-base:latest .

# Test creating a container from the image
docker run -d --name test-container -p 3001:3001 app-builder-base:latest

# Test exec command execution
docker exec test-container ls -la /generated-app
docker exec test-container cat /generated-app/package.json
docker exec test-container pnpm run dev

# Test file modification with base64 (simulating what coding agent will do)
echo "console.log('Modified by coding agent')" | base64 | docker exec -i test-container sh -c 'base64 -d > /generated-app/test.js'
docker exec test-container cat /generated-app/test.js

# Test modifying App.tsx (like the coding agent would)
echo "import React from 'react'; export default function App() { return <div>User requested app</div>; }" | base64 | docker exec -i test-container sh -c 'base64 -d > /generated-app/src/App.tsx'

# Cleanup
docker stop test-container
docker rm test-container
```

### Task 1.5: Container Lifecycle Management Design ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Design temporary container naming convention: `app-builder-{conversationId}-{timestamp}`
- [x] Define container TTL (Time To Live) policy
- [x] Implement container cleanup strategy for local development
- [x] Document resource limits for each container
- [x] Plan for concurrent container limits

**Completion Summary:**
- Naming convention defined: `app-builder-{conversationId}-{timestamp}`
- Container lifecycle policies documented for both local development and production
- Resource limits specified: 512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU per container
- Concurrent container limits planned: Maximum 10 active containers per host
- TTL policies defined: Local = manual cleanup, Production = 30 min auto-removal
- Multiple concurrent containers successfully tested
- Ready for Phase 2: Container Manager Implementation

**Container Lifecycle Policy**:
- **Local Development**: Containers persist until manually removed (easier debugging)
- **Production (Azure)**: Containers auto-removed after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Resource Limits**: Each container limited to 512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU
- **Concurrent Limit**: Maximum 10 active containers per host
